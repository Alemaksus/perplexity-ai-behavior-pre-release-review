# Pre-Release AI Behavior & Risk Review

This repository demonstrates a public, OSINT-based **pre-release behavioral risk review** of an AI product, using Perplexity AI as an example case.

The goal of this project is to show **what kinds of decision and trust risks can emerge from AI behavior before a product is released or widely adopted**, even when answers appear reasonable, well-written, and sourced.

This is not a product comparison, benchmark, or factual accuracy audit.

## What This Project Shows

This repository illustrates how AI systems can introduce **business and decision risks** through:

- how sources are selected and combined
- how uncertainty is communicated (or not)
- how recommendations and alternatives are framed
- how authoritative tone interacts with mixed-quality evidence

The included review focuses on **behavioral patterns**, not on whether individual answers are “correct”.

---

## What Is Included

- **Five raw test cases** representing common real-world user journeys:
  - comparative evaluation
  - capability boundary inquiry
  - purchase decision support
  - drawback-focused inquiry
  - production readiness guidance
- **A synthesized pre-release risk review** identifying cross-cutting risk classes across these journeys
- Clear **scope and limitations** to avoid overgeneralization

All observations are based on publicly accessible behavior using free, logged-out access only.

---

## What This Is Not

This project intentionally does **not** include:

- step-by-step testing methodology
- internal checklists or templates
- instructions for reproducing the analysis
- recommendations for how to “fix” the product
- guarantees of completeness or coverage

The purpose is to demonstrate **the type of insight and framing** such a review provides, not to publish a reusable recipe.

---

## Who This Is For

This kind of review is relevant for:

- Founders and product owners preparing an AI-related release
- CTOs and tech leads responsible for risk and reliability
- Teams integrating AI into user-facing decision flows
- Organizations seeking to reduce uncertainty before launch or rollout

It is especially useful when AI output may influence **user decisions, trust, or expectations**.

---

## Scope & Limitations

- Snapshot-in-time behavior only
- Free, logged-out access path
- No API access or paid features
- OSINT-based review
- No evaluation of factual correctness or internal model design

Observed behavior and sourcing may change over time.

## How This Can Be Used

This repository serves as a **public example artifact** of a pre-release AI behavior & risk review.  
Similar reviews can be performed for other AI products or features, tailored to their specific user journeys, business context, and release goals.
