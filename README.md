# Pre-Release Decision Risk Assessment - Perplexity (Demo Case)

## What This Repository Demonstrates

This repository demonstrates a structured **pre-release decision risk assessment** for an AI product, using Perplexity AI as a demo case. The focus is on **decision exposure** and **behavioral presentation patterns** in user-facing answers—how sources are surfaced, how uncertainty is signaled, and how decision framing can shape user interpretation. The contents illustrate the form and tone of an executive-facing artifact that may be used prior to release or adoption.

## Scope & Boundaries

- **Access mode**: Free, logged-out path only
- **Evidence base**: OSINT snapshot (publicly observable behavior and cited sources)
- **Time-bounded**: snapshot-in-time; behavior and UI signaling may change over time
- **No privileged visibility**: no internal system details, configurations, or operational telemetry

## Intended Audience

- Product owners and release managers evaluating decision-critical exposure
- AI integration leads assessing how outputs may be interpreted in real workflows
- Risk/compliance stakeholders reviewing trust calibration and evidence signaling
- Engineering and QA leads aligning user-facing behavior with release posture

## What This Is Not

- An accuracy audit, benchmark, or performance evaluation
- A claim of correctness or failure for any individual answer
- A comprehensive coverage statement for all user journeys, features, or environments
- An internal systems review (no API, no paid features, no privileged access)

## How This Artifact Can Be Used

The assessment can be used as an executive-facing input when considering pre-release or pre-adoption decisions, particularly where AI outputs may influence purchasing, operational, or implementation choices. It can support discussion about where users may face higher verification friction, where confidence may be miscalibrated, and where decision framing may increase or reduce decision quality. The artifact is intended to help clarify risk posture for decision-critical use versus low-stakes informational use, within the stated OSINT snapshot constraints.
