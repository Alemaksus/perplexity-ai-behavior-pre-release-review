(Executive Summary) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(This assessment consolidates decision-relevant behavioral risk patterns observed across five representative user journeys in Perplexity \(free, logged-out path\). It does not evaluate the factual correctness of answers; it focuses on how outputs present sources, communicate uncertainty, and frame decision guidance.) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Across the assessed journeys, recurring patterns may increase verification burden and may reduce decision quality when outputs appear authoritative while relying on mixed-evidence sources, under-signaled uncertainty, and incomplete alternative framing. These patterns are relevant to pre-release and pre-adoption decisions because they influence user expectations, trust calibration, and the likelihood that users act on outputs without sufficient context.) Tj

(Audience & Use) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Intended for product owners, release managers, AI integration leads, and risk/compliance stakeholders. Relevant for pre-release reviews, pre-adoption evaluation, and decision-critical feature rollouts where user actions may be influenced by AI outputs. Supports decisions about release posture and the degree of exposure appropriate for decision-critical usage. Helps identify where users may face higher verification friction or may miscalibrate confidence due to presentation patterns. Does not replace accuracy testing, security review, or internal system validation.) Tj

(Assessed User Journeys) Tj
T*

(The assessment covers five representative user journey types:) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(- Comparative evaluation \(AI tool comparison\)) Tj
T*
(- Capability boundary inquiry \(limitations and constraints\)) Tj
T*
(- Purchase decision support \(upgrade recommendations\)) Tj
T*
(- Drawback-focused inquiry \(product criticism\)) Tj
T*
(- Production readiness guidance \(engineering and development risk\)) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(These journeys are decision-exposed because users may interpret the output as advisory guidance for real choices \(e.g., selection, adoption, purchase, rollout posture\).) Tj
T*

T*
(Cross-Cutting Risk Classes) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Risk Class 1: Mixed Source Authority Without Signaling) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Responses combine authoritative sources \(official documentation, established media\) with anecdotal or speculative sources \(community discussions, rumors, blog posts\) without clearly signaling differences in evidentiary weight. Claims supported by secondary or interpretive sources may read with the same authority as claims backed by primary documentation. Users may overestimate the reliability of speculative statements or treat anecdotal experiences as broadly representative.) Tj

(- Decision impact potential: High) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Risk Class 2: Uncertainty Not Elevated as a Decision Factor) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Uncertainty is often communicated indirectly through conditional language rather than made explicit as a first-class decision input. For unreleased products or evolving capabilities, speculative information can appear in a similar tone to confirmed information. Users may underestimate the risk of acting on incomplete data or over-trust guidance in contexts where constraints materially matter.) Tj

(Risk Class 3: Alternatives Not Explicitly Contrasted) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Trade-offs are discussed, but opposing viewpoints or ‚Äúwhen the opposite choice is better‚Äù conditions are not consistently contrasted at the claim level. Alternative decision paths \(such as deferring a decision until official information is available\) may be implied but are not clearly framed as viable options. Users may miss safer or more appropriate alternatives.) Tj

(Risk Class 4: Claim-to-Source Traceability Friction) Tj
T*
() Tj
T*
(Sources are present \(inline or as a list\), but the mapping between specific claims and specific sources is not always explicit. Multiple sources may support a category of statements without indicating which source substantiates which claim. This increases verification effort and raises the likelihood that users accept conclusions without checking alignment.) Tj

(Risk Class 5: Confidence Level Not Calibrated to Evidence Strength) Tj
T*

(Responses often use advisory or prescriptive language even when underlying evidence is mixed, speculative, or anecdotal. Conditional limitations may read as general characteristics, and drawbacks are sometimes immediately softened by mitigation within the same narrative. Users may make decisions based on perceived consensus rather than on the strength of primary evidence.) Tj

(Decision quality implications: The observed patterns can increase verification effort because users must interpret source authority, reconstruct claim-to-source links, and infer uncertainty levels from indirect cues. When alternatives are not clearly contrasted, users may default to the most action-oriented framing rather than consider deferral or different decision paths. In higher-trust contexts, these patterns can amplify confidence miscalibration and reduce the clarity of what is known versus what is inferred. In lower-stakes informational use, impacts tend to be limited, but verification friction can still shape user expectations of reliability.) Tj

(Together, these patterns may reduce decision quality by inflating perceived certainty and obscuring the strength of supporting evidence. Under-communicated uncertainty can increase the chance of acting on incomplete or evolving information. When alternatives are not clearly contrasted, users may default to immediate action even when deferral or a different choice would better fit the decision context. Mixed source authority without signaling can shift decisions toward perceived consensus or sentiment rather than evidence strength. Conceptual guidance without prioritization criteria can leave users uncertain about which constraints matter most for their decision.) Tj
